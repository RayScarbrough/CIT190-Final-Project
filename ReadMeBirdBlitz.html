      <h2>Purpose of the Game</h2>
      <p>
        Control a turtle while avoiding birds diving down. The player earns
        points for successfully dodging each bird. The goal is to achieve the
        highest score possible. However, if you're hit by a bird, the game ends.
        The challenge lies in reacting quickly to the birds movements and
        maneuvering the turtle to avoid collisions, testing the player's
        reflexes and agility.

      <h2>Current Problems or Issues</h2>
      <p>
        - The game hit boxes are sometimes unfair and "hit" the player when the
        bird does not.
      </p>
      <p>
        - If the start button is clicked multiple times the birds speed
        multiplies.
