      <h2>Purpose of the Game</h2>
      <p>
        Blackjack provides players with an experience of the classic casino card
        game. The player competes against the dealer to reach a hand value
        closer to 21 without exceeding it.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>1. Start the Game: Place your bet. The minimum bet is $50.</p>
      <p>
        2. Dealing Cards: Once the bet is placed, you and the dealer will each
        receive two cards. In blackjack, the card values are as follows:
        Numbered cards (2 through 10) are worth their face value. Face cards
        (Jack, Queen, and King) are each worth 10 points. Aces can be worth
        either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the player's
        hand the most without exceeding 21.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Playing Your Hand: Choose to 'Hit' to take another card or 'Stand' to
        hold your total and end your turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. End of Game: If your hand exceeds 21 points, you bust and lose the
        game. If you stand, the dealer will play their hand. The best hand wins
        the game.
