      <h2>Purpose of the Game</h2>
      <p>
        Snake is a classic arcade game where players control a snake that grows
        in length as it consumes food items. The objective is to guide the snake
        to eat as much food as possible without colliding with itself or the
        game boundaries.

      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>
        1. Start the Game: Load the game and control the snake using the W A S D
        keys on your keyboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Eating Food: Direct the snake to eat food items that appear on the
        screen. Each food item increases the length of the snake.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Avoiding Collisions: Ensure the snake does not collide with itself or
        the game boundaries. Collisions end the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Scoring Points: Score points for each food item eaten. The game may
        feature additional scoring mechanics or bonuses.

      <h2>Current Problems or Issues</h2>
      <p>
        -The controls sometimes feel clunky when you attempt to turn back into
        yourself. The game is programmed right now to not allow the player to
        turn directly back into themselves. This causes the player to feel as if
        the controls are not responding, even though it is to help the player.

      <h2>Plans to Resolve the Problems or Issues</h2>
      <p>
        -plan a way for the player to turn back the same direction they are
        coming from without hitting themselves or having to clip through the
        snakes body.
